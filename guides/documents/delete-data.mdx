This page shows you how to use the delete endpoint to remove documents from a collection.

## Delete documents by IDs

Since LambdaDB documents can always be efficiently accessed using their ID,
deleting by ID is the most efficient way to remove specific records.

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python
  from lambdadb import LambdaDB

  lambda_db = LambdaDB(
      server_url="PROJECT_URL",
      project_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
  )

  res = lambda_db.collections.docs.delete(
      collection_name="your_collection_name", 
      ids=[
          "example-doc-id-1",
          "example-doc-id-2",
      ]
  )
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -i -X POST \
    --url "$PROJECT_URL/collections/{collectionName}/docs/delete" \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
    --data '{
    "ids": [
      "example-doc-id-1",
      "example-doc-id-2"
    ]
  }'
  ```
  
</CodeGroup>

## Delete documents by query

To delete documents based on their data, pass a `filter` query to the delete operation.
This deletes all document matching the filter query.

For example, to delete all documents with genre "documentary" and year 2019 from a collection, use the following code:

<CodeGroup>
  
  ```python Python
  res = lambda_db.collections.docs.delete(
      collection_name="your_collection_name",
      filter_={
          "queryString": {
              "query": "genre:documentary AND year:2019"
          }
      }
  )
  ```

  ```bash cURL
  curl -i -X POST \
    --url "$PROJECT_URL/collections/{collectionName}/docs/delete" \
    --header 'content-type: application/json' \
    --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
    --data '{
    "filter": {
      "queryString": {
        "query": "genre:documentary AND year:2019"
      }
    }
  }'
  ```

</CodeGroup>

## Delete an entire collection

To remove all documents from a collection,
[delete the collection](/guides/collections/manage-collections#delete-a-collection) and
[recreate it](/guides/collections/create-a-collection#create-a-collection-from-scratch)
