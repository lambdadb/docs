A search query, or query, is a request for information about data in LambdaDB collections.

LambdaDB supports several search methods:

* Search for exact values: search for exact values or ranges of numbers, dates, IPs, or strings.
* Full-text search: use full text queries to query unstructured textual data and find documents that best match query terms.
* Vector search: store vectors in LambdaDB and use approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) to find vectors that are similar, supporting use cases like semantic search.

Common parameters for the request body of a query are as follows:

| Parameter      | Description                                                  | Type    | Required | Default |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------| ------- | -------- | ------- |
| size           | The number of results to return for each query               | integer | ✓        |         |
| query          | Query object (details in later part)                         | object  | ✓        |         |
| includeVectors | Indicates whether vector values are included in the response | boolean |          | false   |
| consistentRead | Determines the read consistency model: If set to true, then the operation uses strongly consistent reads; otherwise, the operation uses eventually consistent reads. | boolean |          | false   |
| fields         | A list of field names to include in the result. Use dot notation (e.g., user.name) to specify nested fields. | string[]  |          | false   |

<Tip>

  Depending on your data and your query, you may get fewer than `size` results.
  This happens when `size` is larger than the number of possible matching documents for your query.
</Tip>

<Warning>

  LambdaDB is eventually consistent, so there can be a slight delay before new or changed documents are visible to queries.
  If your application requires strongly consistent read, set `consistentRead` to true when query your data,
  at the expense of potential high latency and cost.

</Warning>

Query results are returned in the following format:

| Field    | Description                                          | Type      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| took     | Milliseconds it took LambdaDB to execute the request | long      |
| maxScore | Highest returned document `score`                    | float     |
| total    | Metadata about the number of matching documents      | long      |
| docs     | Contains returned documents and metadata             | object[]  |

## Example

```python python
lambda_db = LambdaDB(
    server_url="SERVER_URL",
    project_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)

results = lambda_db.collections.query(
    collection_name=collection_name,
    query={},
    size=10,
    include_vectors=True,
)
```
The response will look like this:

```json
{
  "took": 76,
  "maxScore": 10.691499,
  "total": 1,
  "docs": [
    {
      "collection": "example_collection",
      "score": 10.691499,
      "doc": {
        "id": "33201222",
        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LambdaDB",
        "title": "LambdaDB is awesome",
        "text": null
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Matched documents are ordered by similarity from most similar to least similar by default.
Similarity is expressed as a `score`, and it is calculated based on `BM25 algorithm` for full-text search
and a configured `similarity metric` for vector search.
