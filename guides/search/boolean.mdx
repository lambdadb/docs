title: "Boolean query"
---

A query that matches documents matching boolean combinations of other queries.
The boolean query maps to [Lucene BooleanQuery](https://lucene.apache.org/core/10_2_2/core/org/apache/lucene/search/BooleanQuery.html).

## Boolean Query Array Parameters
When using within a bool query array, each object can contain:

| Parameter | Description                    | Type   | Required | Default |
|:----------|:-------------------------------|:-------|:---------|:--------|
| query     | Query string object            | object | âœ“        |         |
| occur     | Boolean occurrence type        | string |          | should  |
| boost     | Score multiplier for relevance | string |          | 1.0     |

It is built using one or more boolean clauses, each clause with a typed occurrence. The occurrence types are:

### Occur

| Occur    | Description                                                                             |
|:-------- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| filter   | The clause (query) must appear in matching documents. However, unlike `must`, the score of the query will be ignored. Each query defined under a `filter` acts as a logical "AND", returning only documents that match all the specified queries. |
| must     | The clause (query) must appear in matching documents and will contribute to the score. Each query defined under a `must` acts as a logical "AND", returning only documents that match all the specified queries. |
| must_not | The clause (query) must not appear in the matching documents. Each query defined under a `must_not` acts as a logical "NOT", returning only documents that do not match any of the specified queries. |
| should   | The clause (query) should appear in the matching document. Each query defined under a `should` acts as a logical "OR", returning documents that match any of the specified queries. |

### Boost

Boost values that are less than 1.0 will give less importance to this query compared to other ones
while values that are greater than 1.0 will give more importance to the scores returned by this query.


## Examples

### Boolean query with occur

```json
{
  "bool": [
    {
      "queryString": {
        "query": "node_type:NODE"
      },
      "occur" : "filter"
    },
    {
      "queryString": {
        "query": "content:LambdaDB"
      },
      "occur" : "should"
    }
  ]
}
```

This query will return top documents that are both of type `NODE` and have the highest score value.


### Boolean query with boost

<Note>

  The boost value must be greater than zero.

</Note>

```json
{
  "bool": [
    {
      "queryString": {
        "query": "node_type:NODE"
      },
      "boost": 0.8
    },
    {
      "queryString": {
        "query": "content:LambdaDB"
      },
      "boost": 0.2
    }
  ]
}
```

The final score of the matched document is calculated as proportional to the boost values.
