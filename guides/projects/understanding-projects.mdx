title: Understanding projects
---

An LambdaDB project belongs to an organization and contains a number of collections.
Each project is associated with an API key.
In order to make calls to the collection and data LambdaDB APIs, you must provide a valid API key for the relevant project.

## Project ID
Each LambdaDB project has a unique project ID.
To find the ID of a project, use [project](/guides/projects/manage-projects#describe-a-project)
or [collection](/guides/collections/manage-collections#describe-a-collection) describing APIs
to get a complete description of a project or a collection.

<Note>

  Making calls to `projects` APIs require the organization admin API key.

## Rate limit

Each project has a rate limit that is set by the organization admin.
The rate limit is the maximum number of requests that can be made to the LambdaDB APIs in a given time period.
If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.
The rate limit can be adjusted via [project update API](/guides/projects/manage-projects#configure-a-project) with an admin API key.
