This page shows you how to manage your existing collections.

## List collections

Use this operation to get a complete description of all collections in a project:

```bash
LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

curl -i -X GET "https://{projectHost}/collections" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```

The response will look like this:

```json
{
  "collections": [
    {
      "projectName": "<string>",
      "collectionName": "<string>",
      "indexConfigs": {},
      "numDocs": 123,
      "cloneSourceInfo": {
        "sourceProjectId": "<string>",
        "sourceIndexName": "<string>",
        "sourceIndexVersionId": "<string>"
      },
      "collectionStatus": "ACTIVE"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Describe a collection

Use the describe endpoint to get a complete description of a specific collection:

```bash
LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

curl -i -X GET "https://{projectHost}/collections/{collectionName}" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```

The response will look like this:

```json
{
  "projectName": "<string>",
  "collectionName": "<string>",
  "indexConfigs": {},
  "numDocs": 123,
  "cloneSourceInfo": {
    "sourceProjectId": "<string>",
    "sourceIndexName": "<string>",
    "sourceIndexVersionId": "<string>"
  },
  "collectionStatus": "ACTIVE"
}
```

## Delete a collection

Use this operation to delete a collection and all of its associated resources:

```bash
LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

curl -i -X DELETE "https://{projectHost}/collections/{collectionName}" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```
