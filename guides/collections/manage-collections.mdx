This page shows you how to manage your existing collections including listing, describing, and deleting operations.

## List collections

Retrieve a complete list of all collections in your project along with their metadata and status information.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from lambdadb import LambdaDB

lambda_db = LambdaDB(
    server_url="PROJECT_URL",
    project_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

lambda_db.collections.list()
```

```bash cURL
LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

curl -i -X GET "$PROJECT_URL/collections" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

The response includes detailed information about each collection:

```json
{
  "collections": [
    {
      "projectName": "your-project",
      "collectionName": "example-collection",
      "indexConfigs": {
        "title": {"type": "text"},
        "category": {"type": "keyword"}
      },
      "numDocs": 1250,
      "cloneSourceInfo": {
        "sourceProjectId": "source-project-id",
        "sourceIndexName": "source-collection",
        "sourceIndexVersionId": "wR0NyDJbqDiHMaaV597GjczO2oGQyG7T"
      },
      "collectionStatus": "ACTIVE"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Describe a collection

Get detailed information about a specific collection, including its configuration, document count, and current status.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from lambdadb import LambdaDB

lambda_db = LambdaDB(
    server_url="PROJECT_URL",
    project_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

lambda_db.collections.get(collection_name="example-collection")
```

```bash cURL
LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

curl -i -X GET "$PROJECT_URL/collections/example-collection" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

The response provides comprehensive collection details:

```json
{
  "projectName": "your-project",
  "collectionName": "example-collection",
  "indexConfigs": {
    "title": {
      "type": "text",
      "analyzers": ["standard", "korean"]
    },
    "embedding": {
      "type": "vector",
      "dimensions": 768,
      "similarity": "cosine"
    }
  },
  "numDocs": 1250,
  "cloneSourceInfo": {
    "sourceProjectId": "source-project-id",
    "sourceIndexName": "source-collection",
    "sourceIndexVersionId": "wR0NyDJbqDiHMaaV597GjczO2oGQyG7T"
  },
  "collectionStatus": "ACTIVE"
}
```

## Delete a collection

Permanently delete a collection and all of its associated data and resources. This operation cannot be undone.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from lambdadb import LambdaDB

lambda_db = LambdaDB(
    server_url="PROJECT_URL",
    project_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

lambda_db.collections.delete(collection_name="collection-to-delete")
```

```bash cURL
LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

curl -i -X DELETE "$PROJECT_URL/collections/collection-to-delete" \
  -H "x-api-key: $LAMBDADB_PROJECT_API_KEY"
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
Deleting a collection is irreversible and will permanently remove all documents and metadata. Make sure you have proper backups if needed before proceeding with this operation.
</Warning>
