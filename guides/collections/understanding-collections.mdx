title: Understanding collections

An LambdaDB collection is a logical namespace that holds a set of documents,
where each document is a set of fields — which, in turn,
are key-value pairs that contain your data.

Indexes are not the same as you’d find in a relational database.
Think of an LambdaDB project as a database that can contain many collections you can consider as a table,
and within each collection, you have many documents.

* RDBMS => Databases => Tables => Columns/Rows
* LambdaDB => Projects => Collections => Documents with key-value pairs

LambdaDB provides a RESTful JSON-based API for interacting with document data.
You can index, search, and delete documents by sending HTTP requests to the appropriate endpoints.
These CRUD-like operations can take place at an individual document level or at the collection level itself.

## Zero-copy collection clone

Zero-copy collection clone is a feature that allows you to create a new collection by cloning an existing collection,
without physically copying collection data.

This feature is useful when you want to create a new collection with the same configurations and data as an existing collection,
in order to load-test, develop, and experiment in an isolated environment.
