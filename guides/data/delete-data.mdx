This page shows you how to use the delete endpoint to remove documents from a collection.

## Delete documents by IDs

Since LambdaDB documents can always be efficiently accessed using their ID,
deleting by ID is the most efficient way to remove specific records.

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  --url https://{projectHost}/collections/{collectionName}/docs/delete \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  --data '{
  "ids": [
    "<string>",
    "<string>",
    ...
  ]
}'
```

## Delete documents by query

To delete documents based on their data, pass a `filter` query to the delete operation.
This deletes all document matching the filter query.

For example, to delete all documents with genre “documentary” and year 2019 from a collection, use the following code:

```bash
curl -i -X POST \
  --url https://{projectHost}/collections/{collectionName}/docs/delete \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
  --data '{
  "filter": {
    "queryString": {
      "query": "genre:documentary AND year:2019"
    }
  }
}'
```

## Delete an entire collection

To remove all documents from a collection,
[delete the collection](/guides/collections/manage-collections#delete-a-collection) and
[recreate it](/guides/collections/create-aa-collection)
